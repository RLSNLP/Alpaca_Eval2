    "instruction":"How do I make escargot?",
    "output_1":"Escargot is a classic French delicacy made from cooked land snails. It is often served as an appetizer in France and in French restaurants around the world. Here's a simple recipe for making escargot:\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n- 24 canned snails\n- 24 snail shells (if not using pre-shelled snails)\n- 100 grams (approximately 1\/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened\n- 3 to 4 cloves of garlic, finely minced\n- 1 small shallot, finely minced\n- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped\n- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped (optional)\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- A splash of brandy or dry white wine (optional)\n- Pinch of nutmeg (optional)\n- Baguette or crusty bread, for serving\n\n### Equipment:\n\n- Oven\n- Snail dishes or a muffin tin (if you don't have snail dishes)\n- Mixing bowl\n- Piping bag or spoon\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F).\n\n2. **Prepare the Garlic Butter**: In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, minced shallot, chopped parsley, thyme if using, and a splash of brandy or wine if desired. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated.\n\n3. **Fill the Shells**: If you're using shells, fill each shell with a small amount of the garlic butter mixture, then insert a snail, and top it off with more garlic butter to seal the snail inside. If you're using snail dishes or a muffin tin, place a snail in each indentation, and cover with a generous amount of the garlic butter.\n\n4. **Bake the Escargot**: Place the filled snail shells or snail dishes\/muffin tin in the preheated oven. Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the butter is bubbling and slightly browned.\n\n5. **Serve**: Carefully remove the escargot from the oven (they will be very hot). Serve immediately with a baguette or crusty bread to soak up the delicious garlic butter.\n\n### Tips:\n\n- If you're using canned snails, make sure to rinse and drain them before using.\n- If you don't have snail shells and don't want to use a muffin tin, you can create small foil packets to hold the snails and garlic butter.\n- Some recipes also include a small amount of grated cheese, such as Gruy\u00e8re, for an extra flavor dimension.\n- Escargot tongs and forks are traditionally used to hold the shell while extracting the snail with the fork, but you can use regular small forks if you don't have the traditional utensils.\n\nRemember that handling snails and making escargot can be a bit tricky the first time, so take your time and follow the steps carefully.

BEEFY'S BEACH CLUB - DAY\n\nThe sun BLAZES down on a vibrant Miami beach. Palm trees sway gently in the breeze. The sound of WAVES CRASHING and SEAGULLS cawing in the distance. Trendy electronic music pulses from the club. The sign above reads \"Beefy's Beach Club\" in neon letters, with a caricature of a burly, mustached man in a Hawaiian shirt giving a thumbs-up.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. POOL BAR - CONTINUOUS\n\nA glossy blue pool reflects the sun's rays. Surrounding it, bronzed bodies lounge on designer chairs, sipping colorful cocktails. At the pool bar, a tall, lanky figure known as JDEG, sporting a floral shirt and aviator sunglasses, juggles a bottle of rum with flair, pouring a drink.\n\nSophieSnazz, a blonde British woman with a sharp wit and a Snazzier one-piece, leans on the bar, watching with amusement. She occasionally flicks her hair, engaging in banter with the patrons. Her British accent stands out.\n\nA middle-aged, tanned BRITISH MAN, BEEFY, emerges from the club's ornate double doors. He's wearing a ridiculously bright Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops. He surveys his kingdom with pride, a gold chain glimmering on his chest.\n\nBEEFY\n(to himself)\nAh, the sweet smell of sun cream and success.\n\nHe approaches the pool bar where JdeG and SophieSnazz are entertaining the guests.\n\nJDEG\n(winking at a customer)\nAnd that, my friend, is how you make a 'Miami Meltdown.' Guaranteed to knock your flip-flops off!\n\nThe CUSTOMER laughs, taking a cautious sip and nodding appreciatively.\n\nSOPHIESNAZZ\n(playfully to JdeG)\nI bet they'd prefer a 'British Sunburn.' It's red, deceptive, and leaves you feeling sorry the next day.\n\nBeefy chuckles as he reaches the bar, slapping JdeG on the back.\n\nBEEFY\n(booming voice)\nJdeG, SophieSnazz, you two are the gin to my tonic. What's the craic today?\n\nJDEG\nJust keeping the spirits high and the drinks stronger, Beefy.\n\nSOPHIESNAZZ\n(smiling)\nAnd I'm just here to make sure he doesn't burn the place down.\n\nSuddenly, a SCREAM erupts from the pool. Everyone turns to see a MAN in an inflatable flamingo, frantically paddling away from a small SHARK that has somehow found its way into the pool.\n\nBEEFY\n(sighing)\nNot again. JdeG, fetch the net. Sophie, charm the guests. And someone cue the Benny Hill theme...\n\nSophieSnazz rolls her eyes but smirks, moving to calm the guests with her British charm and humor.\n\nSOPHIESNAZZ\n(to the guests)\nNow, now, let's not ruin our mascara. It's just a wee fish with an overbite.\n\nJdeG, still juggling a bottle, nonchalantly grabs a net leaning against the bar while Beefy rushes to the pool, his flip-flops slapping comically against the ground.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nA MONTAGE of Beefy and JdeG hilariously attempting to catch the shark, while SophieSnazz distracts the guests with cheeky jokes and free drinks.\n\nFADE OUT:\n\nThe opening credits start to roll over the chaos, with a funky, darkly comedic tune setting the mood for the ensuing madness that is \"Beachside Blunders.\"\n\nFADE TO BLACK.",

    "output_1":"To prove the given statement \"If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12,\" we need to examine the conditions and the conclusion separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first condition:\n\n1. x is a positive integer.\n\nIf x is a positive integer, then by definition, it is greater than 0 (x > 0). However, being a positive integer does not automatically mean that x > 12. For example, x could be 1, 2, ..., or 12, which are all positive integers but not greater than 12. Thus, the statement does not hold for this condition alone.\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition:\n\n2. x is a solution to x + 3 > 4.\n\nSolving the inequality x + 3 > 4 for x gives us:\n\nx > 4 - 3\nx > 1\n\nSo any solution to the inequality x + 3 > 4 must be greater than 1. Since x > 1, it is true that x > 0; however, being greater than 1 does not imply that x is greater than 12. For example, x could be 2, which is a solution to the inequality but not greater than 12. Thus, the statement does not hold for this condition alone either.\n\nTherefore, whether x is a positive integer or a solution to x + 3 > 4, neither condition guarantees that x > 12. The correct conclusion we can draw is that x > 0, but we cannot conclude that x > 12. Consequently, the given statement is not true as it stands.",
